## Accessing the Admin Panel

4. The admin panel will appear with all collected chat data
5. You can export the data as a CSV file

## Customizing the Chat

You can customize the chat behavior by editing the `llm-chat.js` file:

1. Change the model by updating the `model` property in the `HF_CONFIG` object
2. Adjust response length by changing the `maxTokens` property
3. Make responses more creative or more focused by adjusting the `temperature` property
4. Modify the system prompt to change the assistant's personality and knowledge

## Troubleshooting

If the chat is not working:

1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify that the API key is correctly set in `api-config.json`
3. Make sure the Google Form ID and field IDs are correct in `form-config.json`
4. Try using the fallback responses by temporarily disabling the API key

If data collection is not working:

1. Test the Google Form manually to ensure it's accepting submissions
2. Check that the form fields match the expected format
3. Use the admin panel to verify that data is being saved to localStorage as a backup# Free Open Source Single-Page Resume Template
